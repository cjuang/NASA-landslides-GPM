# NASA-landslides-PMM
The website for the Cooperative Open Online Landslide Repository (COOLR), a global landslide inventory and project created and managed by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). The website points visitors to NASA's landslide efforts, the citizen science web application Landslide Reporter, and the landslide knowledge portal Landslide Viewer. The previous version of the website exists on the GSFC Science and Exploration Directorate (SED) website, science.gsfc.nasa.gov, from March 2018 to present. When website development is complete on the PMM website, this new site will be the new landslides.nasa.gov site.

# languages and tools used
The website is currently being developed from scratch and hosted on the Precipitation Measurement Missions (PMM) website. Programmed in HTML and CSS, using Twitter Bootstrap and JQuery. Materials developed for the website were developed using Adobe Illustrator, GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP), Microsoft Powerpoint, Esri ArcMap and Web AppBuilder, and Shotcut.
