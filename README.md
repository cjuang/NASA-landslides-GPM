# NASA-landslides-PMM
The Landslides @ NASA website for the Cooperative Open Online Landslide Repository (COOLR), a global landslide inventory and project created and managed by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). The website points visitors to NASA's landslide efforts, the citizen science web application Landslide Reporter, and the landslide knowledge portal Landslide Viewer. 

The website is currently hosted on the Precipitation Measurement Missions (PMM) website, https://pmm.nasa.gov. The previous version of the website existed on the GSFC Science and Exploration Directorate (SED) website, https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov, from March 2018 to present (archive can be found at [cjuang/NASA-landslides-SED](https://github.com/cjuang/NASA-landslides-SED)).
