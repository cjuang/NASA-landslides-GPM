			<h3>Why COOLR?</h3>
			<p class = "LRbold">Landslides cause billions of dollars in infrastructural damage and thousands of deaths every year around the world.</p>
			<p>However, to date we do not have a global picture of exactly where and when landslides occur owing to their small size and difficulty in identifying 
			their onset and extent when no one is around to witness their impacts. The COOLR project provides an open platform where 
			scientists and citizen scientists around the world can share landslide reports to guide awareness of landslide hazards for improving
			scientific modeling and emergency response.
			</p>

				<figcaption class="figure-caption">Two satellite images of a 5.5 million cubic meters landslide in the Sunkosi (Sunkoshi) River Valley, northern Nepal, that killed 156 people. The first picture was taken September 2013, and the
				second was taken September 2014, about a month after the landslide happened on August 2, 2014. Images by Jesse Allen using Landsat data from the US Geological Survey.

			<h3 class = "mt-4">What is COOLR?</h3>
			<p>The Cooperative Open Online Landslide Repository (COOLR) is a worldwide database of landslide events. It currently includes NASA’s <a href = "resources.html#GLC">Global 
			Landslide Catalog (GLC)</a> and landslide events contributed by citizen scientists. In a future release of COOLR, collated landslide inventories will be added by REST API or manually.

			<h3 class = "mt-4">Why are citizen scientists needed?</h3>
			<p>NASA's <a href = "resources.html#GLC">Global Landslide Catalog (GLC)</a>—a part of COOLR—provides new insight into landslide hazards around the world, but it has been a manual and very 
			time consuming process that is hard to maintain. In fact, if we sum up all the hours it has taken over the past 10 years to compile this 
			database it would total over 140 days or 84 work weeks. The database is also challenged by biases affecting where and when landslide 
			information is available (for more details please read through the Publications in the <a href = "resources.html">Resources</a> section). Therefore, we are appealing to the global citizen 
			science community to help advance our knowledge of where and when landslides are happening around the world by adding reports to the 
			Cooperative Open Online Landslide Repository (COOLR). Citizen scientists are people like you who can use their knowledge to advance 
			scientific research.</p>
			<strong>Citizen science enables:</strong>
			<ol>
				<li>A collection with as many different sources and as little bias as possible, 
				including local first-hand accounts, reports in other languages, and points from other 
				databases
				<li>More hands to contribute reports, leading to a more up-to-date and thorough
				database
				<li>More awareness and education about landslides as a natural process and natural/man-made 
				hazard
			</ol>
			<p>With the help of citizen scientists like you, we can improve both the quantity and quality of open landslide data to provide a clearer picture of how landslides are shaping our world.</p>

				<figcaption class = "figure-caption">COOLR landslide points (in orange) and NASA landslide susceptibility (blue = low susceptibility, red = high susceptibility), in Central America. Notice that there are a lot of areas with high susceptibility but no landslide reports, 
				signifying we need more data on past landslides to make sure our susceptibility maps are accurate. Image from <a href = "https://landslides.nasa.gov/viewer">Landslide Viewer</a> with added map legend.</figcaption>

			<h5>General</h5>
			<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseThis1" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseThis1">
				+Is my information tied to my landslide reports and made publicly available on COOLR?
			</a>
			<div class="collapse" id="collapseThis1">
				<div class="card card-body">
					No, we do not store any personally identifiable information nor do we make that information public. We ask you to log into Google or Facebook so that the system can generate a unique user ID (a random string of letters and numbers) for you so you can see all of your submitted landslides in Landslide Reporter,
					but we cannot use that user ID to identify you.	For more details about privacy, please refer to our <a href = "privacy.html">Privacy</a> statement.

			<h5>Landslide Reporter</h5>
			<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseThis2" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseThis2">
				+Can I edit/delete my report after I submitted it?
			</a>
			<div class="collapse" id="collapseThis2">
				<div class="card card-body">
					If the submission hasn’t been checked by our team yet, you may edit it under My Submissions. Click on the report you want to edit, and click the pencil icon or trash icon in the top right-hand corner to edit or delete the report.

			<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseThis3" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseThis3">
				+Can I see all my past reports that were accepted to the catalog?
			</a>
			<div class="collapse" id="collapseThis3">
				<div class="card card-body">
					Unfortunately, you cannot see all your past reports in one place after they have been accepted and put in COOLR due to the way our privacy and validation processes work. You can navigate and find them in Landslide Viewer,
					but we do not show your account's system-generated user ID to the public for privacy purposes.
				</div>
			</div><br>
			<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseThis4" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseThis4">
				+Are the submissions quality-checked before they are added to the catalog?
			</a>
			<div class="collapse" id="collapseThis4">
				<div class="card card-body">
					Yes, all reports submitted through Landslide Reporter are quality-checked for accuracy and detail by members of the team at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.

			<h5>Data Download and Analysis</h5>
			<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseThis5" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseThis5">
				+Can I download COOLR for my research?
			</a>
			<div class="collapse" id="collapseThis5">
				<div class="card card-body">
					Yes! The Cooperative Open Online Landslide Inventory (COOLR) is publicly available to download from the <a href="https://landslides.nasa.gov/viewer" target="_blank">Landslide Viewer</a> page.
					We ask that you provide a citation link to the website or, for published articles, cite the dataset following the guidelines in the <a href = "coolrdata.html">Downloading the Data</a> page.
				</div>
			</div><br>
			<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseThis6" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseThis6">
				+I used the Global Landslide Catalog (GLC) in my research. How do I cite it?
			</a>
			<div class="collapse" id="collapseThis6">
				<div class="card card-body">
					If you use the Global Landslide Catalog (GLC) in your research publication, we request that you reference the GLC database following the instructions on the <a href = "coolrdata.html">Downloading the Data</a> page.
				</div>
			</div><br>
			<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseThis7" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseThis7">
				+Is COOLR data currently being used for landslide research?
			</a>
			<div class="collapse" id="collapseThis7">
				<div class="card card-body">
					COOLR is used to validate the Landslide Hazard Assessment for Situational Awareness (LHASA) model being developed at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. COOLR data is compared to the LHASA model "nowcasts" to verify the accuracy of the model. However, since most landslides occur in places
					with no observations, it is not possible to verify its accuracy in all areas. We need a more robust landslide catalog to improve this model, which is where citizen science can help.
					For links to the LHASA publication and more information about the model, see the <a href = "resources.html">Resources</a> page.
