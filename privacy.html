			<p>We welcome and encourage your participation in the Citizen Science Landslide Reporter project.  Our online site and portal system are governed by the general rules of respectful civil discourse. You are fully responsible for everything that you submit.
			<br><br>NASA and the portal system do not discriminate against the source of any submission or any submission.  However, NASA may review any submitted content as it chooses and reserves the right to remove content for any reason whatever, without consent. NASA does not collect or verify the identity of the submitter.
			<br><br><strong>Here are some of the rules that we follow:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>We will remove content that is clearly irrelevant.
				<li>We will remove content that contains abusive, vulgar, offensive, racist, threatening or harassing content, personal attacks of any kind, or offensive terms that target specific individuals or groups.
				<li>We will remove spam and content that promotes services or products, or that involves political campaigning or lobbying.
				<li>We may remove content that contains personal information (whether your own or someone else's), including home address, home or cell phone number, or personal e-mail address, in order to protect privacy.
				<li>Gratuitous links to sites and repeat submissions of the same (or very similar) contributions are viewed as spam and may result in the content being removed.
				<li>Do not contribute anything that you do not have the right to contribute. We will not post comments that appear to post material without permission, and we will follow a notice and takedown procedure for complaints of copyright violation under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
				<li>Only contribute to our site if you are <b>over 13 years of age.</b>
				<li>Communications made through social media posts, e-mail, webinars, and messaging systems will in no way constitute a legal or official notice or comment to NASA or any official or employee of NASA for any purpose.
				<li>All user-generated content is released into the public domain so do not submit anything you do not wish to broadcast to the general public.
				<li>Users who do not comply with these standards of conduct may be blocked.
			</ul>
			<p><strong>In addition to our contribution rules, below are the legal terms you agree to when you use our system. Please keep a copy for your records.</strong></p>
